## Summary

This is a simple goal tracking application that uses Phoenix framework and Elixir. It allows users to create, edit, and delete goals. It's inspired by the idea of ringing a bell when a tast is accomplished. Users can set as many steps as they want for each goal. And they can mark steps as completed as they go, and it will trigger a celebratory sound for the user.
